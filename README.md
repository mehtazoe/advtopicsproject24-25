**Week 3: Project Creation and Documentation**

  This week, I have been learning Flutter basics. See my progress with this document: [Project Creation and Documentation Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14vsrRAfv0Pn8-oCQI32TvQ74bmVPZOzp8kDxRsCqI_Q/edit?usp=sharing)

  Additionally, for my workplace internship class, I have started working on the app to keep track of sales for a local non-profit. See what I have so far at this link (I have mostly been working on the "Cash Order" page): [Sales Tracking App](https://marketmoney-pugh.glide.page)

**Week 4: Project Development Focus + Mentor Matching**

  This week, I worked on building the [Sales Tracking App](https://marketmoney-pugh.glide.page). See my progress and mentor question answers here: [Project Development Focus Path](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-RIdaJHTunxRj5dhKSKQnKovOExqJDPEBoJC9b4MI-8/edit?usp=sharing)

  Additionally, I have been working on finishing up the Girls Who Code camp slides and flyer. 

**Week 5: Mentorship**

  I contacted my mentor by email.

**Week 6: Daily Log of Activites**

  Monday: Fill out Lake County STEM for Girls google forms for my and Pritika's sessions.
  
  Tuesday: Edit Lake County STEM for Girls slideshow to get it ready for the event. 
  
  Wednesday: Worked on app for Libertyville honors society, but it wasn't working. So I asked Shayna for some help.
  
  Thursday: Try out the [Freewebstore](https://admin.freewebstore.com/design_overview.aspx) website that Shayna recommended. It didn't work too well for what I'm looking for. 
  
  Friday: Keep working on the Libertyville honors society app. I researched a new approach to making it and I'm trying it. Unfortunately, I can't add a link to it because I made it a copy of the original one, just in case it doesn't work out and I have to return to the old one. But, essentially, instead of changing the quantity of items in my "cart," I am adding rows to an empty cart. That way, it is easier to just empty the "cart" data table.
