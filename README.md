Week 2: Create a prototype

  Since we have not yet received confirmation that the ARC wants to use our app, we have not created the prototype yet. However, we want the app we create to essentially be very 
  similar to the app linked here created a couple years ago: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-zYHs5gYipVRNGJzMKIrk-HD8fMG9f5DR6zNwKyNlXk/edit?usp=sharing. 

  Since I could not work on the prototype this week, I did the following things instead:

  1. First, I created the slides for the Girls Who Code meeting on Thursday. They are linked here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dXHtq-W7reZOr6pp7jhrIKsbzVwXqElpZTTVLRfFokY/edit?usp=sharing
  2. I started contacting other nonprofit companies to see if they have any coding projects for XPerience interns to work on. You can see my progress here:
