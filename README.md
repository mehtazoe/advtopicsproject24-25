**Week 5: Mentorship**

  I contacted my mentor by email.

**Week 6: Daily Log of Activites**

  Monday: Fill out Lake County STEM for Girls google forms
  
  Tuesday: Edit Lake County STEM for Girls slideshow to get it ready for the event. 
  
  Wednesday: Worked on app for Libertyville honors society, but it wasn't working. So I asked Shayna for some help.
  
  Thursday: Try out the [Freewebstore](https://admin.freewebstore.com/design_overview.aspx) website that Shayna recommended. It didn't work too well for what I'm looking for. 
  
  Friday: Keep working on the Libertyville honors society app. I researched a new approach to making it and I'm trying it.
